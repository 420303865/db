# upper.io/db

`upper.io/db` is a [Go][2] package that allows developers to store and retrive
data to and from different kinds of databases through the use of adapters that
wrap well supported database drivers.

`upper.io/db` is not an ORM, but you may not need one at all:

```go
// This code works the same for all supported databases.
var people []Person
res = col.Find(db.Cond{"name": "Max"}).Skip(1).Limit(2).Sort("-input")
err = res.All(&people)
```

See the project page, recipes and user documentation at [upper.io/db][1].
