// "Where" is a keytype that can handle conditions and operators in an expression.
// Examples:
// Where { "age": 18 } // Means the condition is to have the "age" field equal to 18.
// Where { "age $lt": 18 } // $lt is a MongoDB operator, if you're using MongoDB, means that you want the "age" field to be lower than 18.
// Where { "age >=": 18 } // >= is a SQL operator, if you're using SQL, means that you want the "age" field to be mayor or equal to 18.
type Where map[string] interface{}

// "And" is a keytype that can handle "And", "Or" and "Where" types in an expression.
// Example:
// And (
//   Where { "name": "Peter" },
//   Where { "last_name": "Parker "},
// )
type And []interface{}

// "Or" is a keytype that can handle "And", "Or" and "Where" types.
// Example:
// Or (
//   Where { "year": 2012 },
//   Where { "year": 1987 },
// )
type Or []interface{}

// "Sort" is a keytype for determining the order of the returning Items in Find() or FindAll() expressions.
// Example:
// Sort { "age": -1 } // If using MongoDB, means sort by age in descending order.
// Sort { "age": "ASC" } // If using SQL, means sort by age in ascending order.
type Sort map[string] interface{}

// "Modify" is a keytype that determine values that are going to change in Update() and UpdateAll() expressions.
// Example:
// Modify {
//   "name": "New Name"
// }
type Modify map[string] interface{}

// "On" is a keytype that specifies relations with external collections, the specific relation with the parent expression can be
// determined with the name of field on the external collection plus the name of the referred parent column between brackets, 
// however this can be only used along with Where keytypes.
// Example:
// On {
//   db.Collection("external"),
//   Where { "external_key": "{parent_value}" }, // Relation exists where the "external_key" field is equal to the parent's "parent_value".
// } 
type On []interface{}

// "Relate" is a keytype that specifies a one-to-one relation in Find() and FindAll() expressions. It consists of a name and an On keytype.
// You can use the same keytypes you would use in a normal Find() and FindAll() expressions besides a Collection, you can also use 
// other nested Relate and RelateAll statements. If no Collection is given, the one with the relation name will be tried.
// Example: 
// Relate {
//   "father": On {
//     db.Collection("people"),
//     Where { "gender": "man" },
//     Where { "id": "{parent_id}" },
//   }
// }
type Relate map[string] On

// "RelateAll" is a keytype that specifies a one-to-many relation in Find() and FindAll() expressions. It consists of a name and an On keytype.
// You can use the same keytypes you would use in a normal Find() and FindAll() expressions besides a Collection, you can also use 
// other nested Relate and RelateAll statements. If no Collection is given, the one with the relation name will be tried.
// Example: 
// RelateAll {
//   "children": On {
//     db.Collection("people"),
//     Where { "age $lt": 12 },
//     Where { "parent_id": "{_id}" },
//   }
// }
type RelateAll map[string] On

// "Limit" is a keytype that limits the number of results a FindAll() expression returns.
// Example:
//   Limit(10)
type Limit uint

// "Offset" is a keytype that specifies how many matched results will be skipped in a FindAll() expression before returning.
// Example:
//   Offset(10)
type Offset uint
